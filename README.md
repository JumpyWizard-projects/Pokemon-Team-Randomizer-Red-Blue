# Pokemon-Team-Randomizer-Red-Blue

For more Information on my Projects visit https://jumpywizard-projects.github.io/klopstock/pokemonpartyrandomizer.html

This is a Pokemon Red and Blue Team Randomizer which Randomizes your Team before every battle.
It keeps your old Pokemons Levels, IVs, EVs and HP and translates based on that stats for a new random Pokemon with new random moves.


The Idea came from the Youtuber Smallant1, but this project is entirely created by me and is in no way affiliated with him. It also has its own quirks to make this challenge run a new and interesting one.
